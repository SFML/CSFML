# PRELUDE: A note on rpaths #
# ========================= #

# Unlike Windows, Linux doesn't search the current directory by default when searching for shared libraries (.so)
# It only searches the system default directories (usually /lib and /usr/lib) and the paths in LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# The .NET Runtime will find the CSFML library in its NuGet packages just fine, but that library will then request
# the OS for libsfml-(module).so, and the .NET Runtime will have no say in how that SFML library is found.

# Without SFML installed globally on the system, this will fail, causing the loading of CSFML to fail, causing the
# .NET Runtime to think the CSFML library doesn't exist or is invalid.

# And so, we need to set the rpath of the CSFML library.
# The rpath is a special value embedded straight into a library that specifies to the OS a list of folders where
# other libraries that it references may be found.
# $ORIGIN, a kind-of environment variable, can be used in rpath to point to the folder where the library currently is.
# To let the OS know that we intend to use $ORIGIN, we need to add the ORIGIN flag to our ELF with the -z origin
# gcc linker option

# Since CSFML and SFML will always be deployed on the same folder by NuGet, we just need to add an rpath to CSFML
# that points to $ORIGIN, causing the OS to search the current folder for SFML, without interference from .NET

# We also add the same rpath to SFML itself for future-proofing, in case we ever decide to ship some Linux SFML
# dependencies on the Native package.
